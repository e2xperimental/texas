## Take the scenic route from Lakeline to Downtown.

Did you know you can purchase and activate multiple tickets on the Capmetro app?
Just purchase the tickets and select them for activation at the "Use Tickets" screen.
The CapMetro App will activate all of your tickets at the same time and display the expiration date of the ticket with the least time on the screen.
For instance, if you purchase and activate one 7-Day Pass and one Day Pass at the same time, the expiration date on the screen will be that of the one Day Pass. The one Day Pass will no longer show in your queue after it expires.
